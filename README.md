# cdxToWordTable
Convert SDF to cdx format and insert ChemDraw Object in a Microsoft Word ( docx ) Table

This issue arises yearly for our Chemists as they write patents and every year, they complain about it.  Not finding any solutions on the web, I explored this problem learning the VBA through Win32 tools to investigate the structure of the desired object.
